Implemented a dynamic metric selector (orders, sales, profit, return rate) linked to a stacked bar chart for multi-period trend analysis (year, quarter, month).
Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to custom measures and calculations to derive meaningful insights.
Created a dynamic metric selector (orders, sales, profit, return rate) linked to a stacked bar chart, enabling flexible trend analysis across quarters and years.
Integrated a What-If parameter for price adjustment simulation, using line and clustered column charts to assess revenue and profitability underpricing scenarios.
Delivered actionable insights: a 10% price increase resulted in a 10% rise in adjusted sales and a 24% increase in profit.
