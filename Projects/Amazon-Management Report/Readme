Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze Amazon sales performance across key business metrics, including revenue, profit, return rates, product categories, and regional trends.
The dashboard features dynamic filtering, drill-through functionality, and KPI indicators to monitor actual sales against defined targets.
The sales performance analysis revealed consistent gaps between sales goals and actual outcomes, with the most recent KPI visual highlighting a sales goal of $10.10M vs. actual sales of $9.19M, reflecting a performance shortfall of -9.09%.
These insights support for better strategic planning, product optimization, and performance tracking across business units.

Project Outcome: The dashboard enabled stakeholders to monitor key KPIs, track sales targets, and derive actionable insights to support strategic decision-making.
